        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <p>Born in the Ozarks of Missouri and raised in the Wyoming mountains as a youngster, I have a healthy love for travel and nature. My love for Web Development was realized while messing with code on Myspace with Tom as my first friend! My 17 year career has included: Web Development, Graphic Design, Advertising, Marketing, and a splash of Disney World Photography. I am currently concentrating solely on Web Development.</p>
